#Assignment 2 - Lexical Scoping
#Write the following functions
#1) makeCacheMatrix: this funcction creates a special matirx object that can cache its inverse
#2) cacheSolve: This function conmputes the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
    #If the inverse has already been calculated and not changed, then it should retrieve previous results.
#3) the solve() function can be used to calculate an inverted matrix.


## First function, set null inverse matrix, retrieve matrix, set list of functions

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
